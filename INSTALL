Natural Language Generator (NLG)
================================

This INSTALL file explains the compilation process that
has to be carried out in order to obtain a binary
runnable distribution of the NLG.

The folder where this file is located is referred to as the
root folder, "nlg", and it should contain the 
source code files, dependencies, and all the needed resources
to build the project.


Premake4 build script generation tool
------------------------------------
Firstly, the premake4 tool has to be available in the execution
PATH of the working environment. Premake4 may be obtained from:

    http://industriousone.com/premake


The Boost Iostreams Library external dependency
-----------------------------------------------
The Boost Iostreams Library (libboost_iostreams) has to be available 
in the system.


NLG building
------------
Once in the root folder, the premake4 will be in charge
of the compilation process just by typing:

    premake4 gmake; make

The binaries of the project should be obtained within a few seconds
in the "bin" folder.

The debug compilation mode is the default. For the release, run:

    premake4 gmake; make config=release

Finally, the documentation of the project may be generated with doxygen,
which is usually available in the software package repositories of the
common user-oriented GNU/Linux distributions. Run:

    doxygen doc/nlg.dox.cfg

and the HTML documentation files should be made available in the "doc/html"
folder.

The project may be cleaned by typing:

    make clean; premake4 clean; rm -rf doc/html/*
